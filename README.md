Night Flight
========

I'd like to track the tweets of those who are up when most others are asleep. The initial query will use a filter catching only tweets made in the late hours of their tweeters' night, based on their locations.

For this iteration, I'd like to focus on a handful of American cities and towns, but in the future I'd like to enable the tool to track based on zip codes and their international variations.

Over-arching Interests
------------------
* forcing semi-anonymous publishing actions to meet the private specificity of time and space
* what's keeping America up?
