Tracking Late-Night Tweeters
------------------------

I'd like to track the tweets of those who are up when most are asleep. For this iteration, I'd like to focus on a handful of American cities and towns, but in the future I'd like to enable the tool to track based on zip codes/international variations.

Over-arching Interests
------------------
* forcing semi-anonymous publishing actions to meet the private specificity of time and space
* what's keeping America up?
